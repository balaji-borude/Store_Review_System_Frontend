## About

The Store Review System Frontend is a React application designed to provide a user-friendly interface for customers to leave reviews for stores and for businesses to manage and respond to these reviews. It aims to bridge the gap between consumers and businesses by facilitating transparent feedback and fostering improved customer service. The application is built with a focus on modern web development practices, utilizing React for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering capabilities.

This project solves the problem of fragmented and often unreliable review systems. By providing a centralized platform, both customers and businesses can benefit from a streamlined review process. Customers can easily share their experiences, while businesses can gain valuable insights into customer satisfaction and areas for improvement. The target audience includes both consumers looking to make informed purchasing decisions and businesses seeking to enhance their reputation and customer relationships.

The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It interacts with a backend API (not included in this repository) to fetch and submit review data. The application leverages modern UI/UX principles to ensure a seamless and intuitive user experience. Key technologies include React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Review Submission**: Users can easily submit reviews for stores, including ratings and comments.
- ⚡ **Fast Performance**: Optimized React components ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.
- 🎨 **Intuitive UI**: Clean and modern design for easy navigation and interaction.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
- 🛠️ **Customizable**: Easily customizable components and styles to match branding requirements.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Clone and run in 3 steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/balaji-borude/Store_Review_System_Frontend.git
cd Store_Review_System_Frontend
npm install && npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git

### Option 1: From Source
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/balaji-borude/Store_Review_System_Frontend.git
cd Store_Review_System_Frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

## 💻 Usage

### Basic Usage

To use the application, simply start the development server as described in the Installation section. Once the server is running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Interacting with the Backend API

The frontend interacts with a backend API to fetch and submit review data. You will need to configure the API endpoint in the application's configuration file (see Configuration section).

```javascript
// Example of fetching reviews from the API
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function ReviewList() {
  const [reviews, setReviews] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchReviews() {
      const response = await fetch('/api/reviews'); // Replace with your API endpoint
      const data = await response.json();
      setReviews(data);
    }

    fetchReviews();
  }, []);

  return (
    <ul>
      {reviews.map(review => (
        <li key={review.id}>{review.comment}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

export default ReviewList;
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```

### Configuration File

You can also configure the application using a configuration file (e.g., `config.json`):

```json
{
  "apiBaseUrl": "http://localhost:8000/api",
  "theme": "light"
}
```
